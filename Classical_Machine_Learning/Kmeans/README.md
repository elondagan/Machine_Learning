# K-means (2020)

Implement the K-means algorithm from scratch for classifying DNA samples 


Description:

We are given a dataset named “Leukemia.csv” which describes a sample of size 281 where each sample has 22,284 features, each represents a gene and has a label of one of the types of blood cancer (7 in total).

Our goal is to implement the K-means algorithm from scratch for classifying the samples, using two different methods – single link and complete link
